# Technique Class
## Premises
* Class is about technique, not physique
* If you prepare for competition or want a physicaly demanding workout you have to add that to your own schedule
* Entry barrier should be low
* Higher Belts should be able to coach and instruct
* Bite size information gets digested easier
* Learning from order towards the chaos is easier than vice-versa
* Knowledge needs to be revisited repeatedly
* Concepts over blind reproduction
* Questions and feedback help everyone understand 

## Warm-Up (15 mins)
### Goals
- Pepare body and mind for grappling while reducing the risk of injury
- Keeping the entry barrier low

### Antigoals
- Exhaust condition and focus, because this will reduce focus and attention span
- Increase the risk of injury
- Setting a high entry barrier for mobility/flexibility/condition/strength

### Example
* 5 Minutes Mobilisation
* 5 Minutes Functional/Animal Movements beneficial for the days practice
	* Standup
		* Inchworms
		* Jacaré/Spiderman
		* Chicken Walk
	* Open Guard/Back-Control: 
		* Shrimps
		* Forward Buttscoots/Crab Walk
		* Granby-Rolls/Around The World
	* Closed Guard
		* Butterly Pushes
		* Jacaré/Spiderman
	* Side-Control/Mount
		* Shrimps
		* Inchworms
		* Jacaré/Spiderman
* 5 Minutes Technical Warm-Up
	* Flow drill technique of previous week
* No conditioning or strength as this drains energy and focus, especially for people with low training intensity
	* Can be used for people who're more than 5 Minutes late

## Technique
### Goals
- Move from order to chaos
- Value concepts over applications

### Antigoals
- Not having context
- Not focusing on 

### Example
* Technique should idealy involve different segments to be picked apart seperately (e.g. side control, armbar, escape)
* Parts of the technique should be revisted iteratively (e.g. Week 1, 4 and 7)
* Show the technique as a whole once
* Explain the physical/anatomical concept and factors involved
* Start step by step at the end going backward
* Students should use progressive resistance 
* Every round the class is split into students with and without problems
	* Without Problems: Highest rank is put in charge, the rest gets with a higher stronger or more experienced partner
	* With Problems: Show the problem to the group and gather input from peers and instructor, then join first group
* Class can be loosened up to increase concentraction and regain focus
	* Make the technique an infinite flow drill
	* How your partner your favourite submission from the control position of the day
### Levels of Depth
1. Concept
2. Application
3. Identifying Waypoints
4. Creating Dilemmas

## Sparring (30 Mins)
### Goal
- Learn to apply learned techniques in a closed to real world fight scenario

### Antigoal
- Spar at the brink of your capabilities

### Start-Off (15 Mins)
* First Round: Flow-Rolling with <25% intensity, no submission holds
* Second Round: Trap-Sparring with <50% intensity, submission holds with chance to escape, no submission finish
* Third Round (Split-Round): Positional-Sparring with up <75% intensity, only technique of the day, reset on submission or change of control

### Small Class: Regular Sparring (15 Mins)
* Unless pairing decides to practice takedowns explicitly, the higher rank always gives away a control position of the lower ranks choosing

### Big Class: Positional Shark Tanks (15 Mins)
* Split class by experience/weight into brackets of 3-5 people
* Goal: Get or escape the technique of the day in under 2 minutes
	* White Belts: Start with loose submission hold
	* Blue Belts: Start in control position
	* Purple Belts and above: Start in neutral position
* First player gets into defensive technique position
	* Defensive player wins if he/she escapes, scores points or time runs out
	* If defensive player wins: He/She coaches the next defensive player, then gets back in line
* Second player gets into aggressive technique position
	* Aggressive player wins if he/she submits
	* If the aggressive player wins: He/She gets into the defensive position

## Stretching (10 Mins)
