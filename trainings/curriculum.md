# Curriculum
## Segmentation
## Building the Year
To address both beginners and advanced, the year's technique difficulties could be split (Jan-Mar: Beginners, Apr-Jun: Intermediate, Jul-Sep: Advanced, Nov-Dec: Intermediate). This would pay tribute to the high load of beginners in January as well as rewarding to people coming during nice weather in summer. Additional Beginners Courses could be implemented end of Summer leading up to the second Intermediate term.

## Tournament Seasons
Spring and Autumn are high season for tournaments and training should revolve more around takedowns, sweeps, positional control and defense in this time, to enable everyone to get into positions to play their game.

## Conceptual Technique Rotations
Concepts should be repeated every other week and revisited with different techniques. Each rotation is interrupted with one or two different concepts that go through the same cycle. Concepts and techniques are destinguished here techniques can be used to demonstrate different concepts.
