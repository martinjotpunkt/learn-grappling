# Defence
The premise behind Defensive BJJ is to defend attacks before the need to escape arises with techniques as generally viable as possible. The main concept that allows this is that defense in grappling is mainly about [[control |controlling]] the body, which is gained by invading the space between armpit and knee to gain control over hip and/or shoulders and restrict movement. 
The goal of Defensive BJJ is not to stay in a defensive position forever, but to slow down the fight and gain awareness of leaving controlled openings that allow counter attacks or even giving away positions considered more dangerous, while staying in control over the terms.

## Premise

## Foundations
### Tucked elbows
As the underhook is a fundamental element of control arms should always be tucked to your hips  to avoid underhooks and armbars.

### Never "Back"-Down
Never lie down flat on the ground or let your opponent force your spine onto the ground. Lying flat on the back with your hip and shoulder pinned to the ground will heavily impair movement. 

## Positions
### Panda

### Turtle
### Hawking
### Baby Bridge
Lie on the side, pull knees into ~90° angles, thighs clenched to defend weaving, and angle the top leg 45° to your butt with toes active.
Clech your top elbow to your side side, elbow touching the hip bone, hand on the sternum, ready to handfight.
The bottom elbow in the mat at 45° angle to base, hand tucked, ready to handfight.
