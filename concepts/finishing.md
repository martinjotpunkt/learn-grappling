## [Position over Submission](https://bjjmentalmodels.wpcomstaging.com/position-over-submission/)
* Match up your position to your submission (inside leg control/outside leg control, don't work to or from positions that don't favour your gameplan)
* You should always evaluate your own and your opponent's [[alignment]]

### 3 Joint Rule
To counteract the mobility, the three jointed composition of human limbs offer, this rule can be applied to significantly increase joint manipulation success. To reduce chance of escape for any arm/leg-lock, control must be established on all three joints along the limb:
- **Arm**: Wrist, Elbow and Shoulder
- **Leg**: Ankle, Knee and Hip

The same principle can be applied to arm-drag and single leg takedowns.

### Probabilistic Thinking and Risk Management
Getting into a [[control#Position|control position]] is often a lot of work that is one opening away from failure, and at worst, reversal. So we want to establish these positions not to dive for high-risk submissions with low probability, but try to maintain our position as good as possible while attempting submissions or transition equally valuable transitions.
Always consider the probability of success against the potential results of failure and go for the lowest risk first, which is especially true for [[finishing#Comitted Techniques|comitted techniques]].  
One rule of thumb is never to sacrifice a [[control#Major Control Points|major control]] for a [[control#Minor Control Points|minor control]] (e.g. give up [[mount]] to go for a regular [[armbar]]).

### Comitted Techniques
This classifies techniques that require you to abandon your [[control#Position|position]]. Often these techniques have [[finishing#Probabilistic Thinking and Risk Management|high chance of failure and low probability]] and often end in reversal of [[control]] (e.g. [[armbar#Flying Armbar|Flying Armbar]]).

## [Chokes](https://bjjmentalmodels.wpcomstaging.com/choking-mechanics/)
* Hurting chokes are inaccurate, closing the arteries shouldn't require force
* Place coronary arteries directly in elbow-/knee-pit, rotate head if necessary
* Head and Arm Chokes - Find spot with stretched arm, push whole shoulder from the blade upward into the artery before flexing choking arm
* Evolve a 360Â° game by finding which submission you do best with which arm/leg
