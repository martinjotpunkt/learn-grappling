# Control

## Alignment
A good alignment consists of three components which you want to maintain yourself and break down in your opponent's to minimize their ability to utilize their strength, while maximizing your own.

### Posture
The effective positioning of your neck and spine, which, ideally should be errect and aligned, opposed to bend and twisted, to fully engage your core. 

### Structure
Describes the use of your limbs and bones to efficiently withstand opposing pressure (e.g. by [[#Frames|framing]]).
Be aware that structural integrity is compromised when **limbs pass center line** of the body. 

### Base
Is the ability to excert control and generate force by compacting on a low and absorb by distributing weight to a big surface area while using balance to maintain this during motion.

#### Tethering
Tethering your body to your opponent's core will increase their ability to bring your body in motion.
Tethering your core to [[#Minor Control Points]] however, will increase the overwhelming force you can apply.

## Position
Positions are direct applications of the [[#Alignment|alignment]] principles and their quality is directly defined by how well these principles are applied. Establishing and maintaining these principles is more important than keeping the textbook position.

### [Head Position](https://bjjmentalmodels.wpcomstaging.com/head-position/)

### Waypoints (Pit Stops)
Waypoint or Pit stop positions are positions that not necessarily enforcing control, but offer you entrance to many other techniques while, ideally, minimizing your opponents options (e.g. headquarters, prayer position, [[half_guard|half guard]], ...).

### Placeholders
Always make sure that all your five weapons (legs, arm, and head) are engaged usefully in the fight. Especially when transitioning from one position to another it's important to establish a second point of control before abondoning the first.

### Control Points

#### Major Control Points
Control over one of the main control points will dictate in which direction the body can go. Forcing two of these into different directions will immobilize the body.
- **Head** 
- **Shoulders**
- **Hips**

#### Minor Control Points
Arrms and legs are considered minor control points, because, due to the rotational capabilities, provide limited ability dictate

#### Critical Control Points
Every technique relies on control over few points that define success or failure and how easy it is for your opponent to turn it around.
- **2 Joint Rule**: To establish positional control over any limb you need to dominate two joints along the line
- **Double Trouble**: To fully control a nearside limb, you must also control the farside limb


### Placeholders
Always make sure that all your five weapons (legs, arm, and head) are engaged usefully in the fight. Especially when transitioning from one position to another it's important to establish a second point of control before abondoning the first.

### Ratchet Control
Adding rotation by keeping the [[#Levers|lever]] perpendicular to the bending direction will increase effectiveness by reducing effectiveness of defensive muscles.
- **Internal Rotation**: Against the natural range of motion (e.g. Heel Hook)
- **External Rotation**: Into the natural range of motion (e.g. Americana)

### Inside Control

#### Knee Reaping
The IBJJF definition of Knee Reaping is the following:
> "Knee reaping is characterized by when one of the athletes places his thigh behind the leg of his opponent and passes his calf on top of the opponent’s body above the knee, placing his foot beyond the vertical midline of the opponent’s body and applying pressure on his opponents knee from the outside, through inside, while keeping the foot of the leg at risk trapped between his hip and armpit. 
>It is not necessary for one of the athletes to hold the foot of his opponent in order for the foot to be considered trapped. 
>For purposes of this rule, when one athlete is standing and bearing their weight on foot of the same leg as the knee in danger, the foot will be considered trapped."

So the conditions are:
1.  Thigh behind the opponent's leg.
2.  Calf on top of opponent's body above the knee
3.  Foot beyond vertical midine of opponent's body
4.  Applying pressure from outside true inside
5.  Keeping the leg of the foot at risk trapped

## Pressure
Limiting the surface area with the

## Passing
* Passing on the opponents weak side increases chances of success
* Establishing underhook on non-threatened side, then force opponent to switch sides to utilize the underhook
* Guards consist of several layers that are bessed deconstructed one by one

## Posts
Anchoring an extremity to the ground angling it directly against the force vector.

## Frames
Frames are a significant element of defence, used to maintain space between you and your opponent. By a rule of thumb the less joints are involved in a frame and the closer it is to your core, the more stable it will be. As good framing relies on skeletal alignment rather than muscles it should not require excessive amounts of strength. 

## Levers
Levers are force multipliers, and are the most efficient way to create openings and attack your opponent’s body. While the head primarily attacks the [[#posture]], arms and legs attack the [[#structure]] of your opponent.

## Wedges
There are two types of wedges:
- **Blocking Wedges**: Immobilize a part of your opponent's body and go hand in hand with [[#evers]].
- **Prying Wedges**: Pry open your opponent's [[#Frames|frames]]

## Grips
Handfighting should start as early as possible and as long as your opponent is in handfighting distance. The goal is to get control over your opponent and/or stop him from getting control over you.

### S-Grip
To place this grip, you hook your fingers of one hand onto the fingers of the other hand, which makes a shape like an S. This grip works best to defend against a force trying to pull the hands directly linear away from one another.

### Monkey Grip
Tucking your thumbs to your index fingers forming flat hands that can be cupped around e.g. your opponent's neck makes it easy for you to make your hands strong enough to pull your opponents towards your body, gaining leverage and control over them.
One of the best options for clinching game.

### Gable Grip
Form a [[grips#Monkey Grip |monkey grip]] with both hands, connect at the palms and close your hands. This lock works great when force is applied from the intersection of the hands directly into the joined, away from the body.

### Pretzle Grip

### Butterfly Grip
This grip is a variation of the [[grips#Gable Grip |gable grip]] that is extended across for grasping your arms.
The purpose of this grip is to have the wrist hooks bend against each other in order to boost the strength of your grip. In this grip, the elbows remain close to the ribs.

### C-Grip
Tuck all fingers but the thumb together and spread the thumb away so the negative space between them forms a "C". This can be most effectivelly used in arm or knee pits when pushing upward into your opponent.

### Ball And Socket Grip
To perform this grip you form [[grips#Monkey Grip |monkey grips]] with both hands and while one remains flat, the other closes where the ulna connects to the hand.
This grap exposes the wirst between radial and thumb bone while staying flat enough to be driven into tight spaces.

### Figure Four Grip
To perform a figure four grip you hold onto the further part of an extremity (e.g. wrist) with one hand and while the second goes under a closer part (e.g. upper arm) of the same extremity before connecting to your own hand using a [[grips#Ball And Socket Grip |ball and socket grip]]. This grip is used as an immensely strong control position for Americana, Kimura and Toe-Hold Submissions.

### Four-Finger Grip
This grip is used to establish a hold in fabric, where the fingers from index to little are used to form a cup behind the seam to tuck into to increase surface area and friction when closing the fist. When obiding by competition rules it's important to keep in mind, that the four fingers need to stay on the outside of sleeves and pants, but can be used on the [[#High Collar Grip|high collar]] where the grip can be inverted and twisted to generate more friction and control.  

### Pistol Grip
The pistol grip can be established by folding available fabric into a grip that is then enclosed in a fist. This grip is useful reduce margin between fabric and skin, offering a more efficient leverage and transmission of power

### High Collar Grip
A high collar grip is a [[#Four-Finger Grip|four finger grip]] established in the collar, behind the neck where it can be used with the forearm to generate leverage to break the opponent's posture.

### Collar Tie
The lead hand is placed around the backside of the neck on the same side far enough to generate pressure from the opposite side with the tip of the fingers while pulling down and into the grip. The forearm drives into the collarbone of the same side and the forehead into the other.

### Russian Tie
The Russian Tie or Russian 2-on-1 is a standup control grip where your one hand (e.g. right) graps your opponents opposite side (e.g. right) wrist with a [[grips#C-Grip |C-Grip]] from below and your other hand (e.g. left) grabs the biceps of the same arm (e.g. right) from under the arm, using a [[grips#Monkey Grip |Monkey Grip]] to control the shoulder, while you place your temple on your opponents same side shoulder (e.g. right) and push the top of your head into the side of his neck. It offers a good control and takedown defense while opening takedown opportunities.

### Seatbelt Grip
Much like a seatbelt, this grip is established by connecting one [[#Overhook|overhooked]] to an [[#Underhook|underhooked]] hand across the chest (or the back), usually via [[#Ball And Socket Grip|ball and socket]] or [[#Gable Grip|gable grip]] to generate inward pressure. This will [[#Tethering|tether]] your body to the opponent and is a great choice for stopping the them from turning away from you.

### Chin Strap


## Hooks
#### Underhook
By driving your arm between your opponent's flank and arm you establish underhooks which are one of, if not the most important, measure to control your opponent. The higher the underhook and the smaller the length between yours and your opponent's shoulder, the harder it is for your opponent to [[scrambling#Pummeling|pummel]] back inside, which is why you should try and go for deep underhooks, pushing your shoulder into the opponent's armpit and your forehead to his/her temple

#### Invisible Underhook
* Go for the invisible underhook whenever the knee is on or close to the ground

#### Hammerlock

## Clamps
Clamps are formed when we lock a portion of our opponent’s body inside of a closed kinetic chain by clasping your legs or arms together or onto immovible parts of our body. This control mechanism acts as an anchor slowing down your opponent, and tethers your body to theirs.

### Upper Lower Alteration
If we want our opponent from moving, an option is to clamp with our legs and arms. If we want to move along body, however, we switch up bottom and top clamps so one controls while the other manipulates.

## Pacing
To gain control in a fight you have to lead by being active, not reactive and be one step ahead of your opponent so the only option for him/her is follow and try to catch up. This can be achieved by [[finishing#Chaining|chaining]] while in control or laying out traps to regain control from a defensive position.
