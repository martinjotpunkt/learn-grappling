# Armbar
## Variations
### Farside Armbar

### Japanese Armbar
The difference to the regular armbar with the Japanese Armbar variation is in the positioning of the legs. While usually both legs are across the opponent's body, here the shinbone of the leg securing the lower torso, is pressed into the armpit, while the leg controlling the head clenches the heel into the farside neck muscles.

### Combat Armbar
### Crooked Armbar
This armbar uses a similar mechanic than the [[americana|Americana]] as it's using an inward elbow rotation while extending the arm.

Hold onto the opponent's wrist of the arm located under your side and lead it into your top leg's kneepit. Contract your top leg to keep the arm trapped while bringing your knee to the mat, sliding your foot backward and applying downward pressure onto the isolated shoulder to finish.
