# Americana
The americana is a figure four shoulder lock that is easier the higher the opponent's elbows are. Your opponent's shoulders should be immobilized and pinned to the ground to effectively finish this submission. Use your forearm to frame against your opponent's opposite side (e.g. left vs. left) and pin it to the ground, catching the wrist when he/she tries to slide off upward. Weave your free arm under tour opponents arm and connect to your wirst using [[control#Ball And Socket Grip|Ball and Socket Grip]] to connect the figure four lock. Drag the pinned wrist in a tight arch toward your opponent's same side hip while lifting his/her elbow away from him/her in an inward rotation.

Hold onto the opponent's wrist of the arm located under your side and lead it into your bottom leg's kneepit. Contract your leg to keep the arm trapped, apply downward pressure onto the isolated shoulder and move your hip for- and your bottom leg backward.
