# Arm Triangle
## Synonyms
* Head and Arm Choke
* Side Choke

## Adjustments
### Arm Separation

### Breaking [[arm_triangle#Mount: Hug |Hug Defence]]
Crawl choking arm up and grap over the head to the temple and pull into choking arm before lifting the hip and pressuring into opponent

## Variations
### Mounted Head and Arm
* Establish Head and Arm Control
* Connect hands with [[grips#Gable Grip|Gable Grip]] and place elbow of long arm into the liver
* Lift opponent enough to place ear under shoulder blade before push elbow into socket with head

## Defences
### Hug
While arm is not separated, hugging can prevent this from happening, while offering little offensive value and only buys time.

### Hodor
Use the separated arm to [[grips#C-Grip |C-Grip]] the choking elbow, while connecting your free arm via [[grips#Ball And Socket Grip|Ball and Socket Grip]] and pull down to free your neck and buy time. 

## Escapes
### Knee Hug
Lift your legs and hip off the mat toward your chest and hug your inner leg with the separated arm, either [[arm_triangle#Knee Hug - Kick Out |Kicking Out]] or [[arm_triangle#Knee Hug - Rock Back |Rocking Back]].

#### Knee Hug - Kick Out
Connect the hugging hand to the free one, using an [[grips#S-Grip |S-Grip]] and kicking out with the hugged leg.

#### Knee Hug - Rock Back
Use the forward motion, generated from the attempt of sitting up, to rock back up into a sitting position. While this will be harder to accomplish against heavy pressure, it is leaves less room for follow up attacks and can be followed by [[arm_triangle#Slap Back, Wipe Clean |Slap Back]]- or [[arm_triangle#Backward Rollover|Rollover]]-escapes.

### Slap Back, Wipe Clean
Bridge and throw arm back onto the mat in an arch and sweep under head. Works best after a failed [[arm_triangle#Knee Hug |Knee Hug]] attempt.

### Backward Rollover
After attempting a [[arm_triangle#Knee Hug |Knee Hug]] build up backward momentum and roll over.
