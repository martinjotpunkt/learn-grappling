# Side Control
## Variations
### Scarf Hold (Kesa-Gatame)
From regular side-control, pick up your opponent's near side elbow and shoot your leg, which is located near your opponent's hip, under his/her arm and drive your hip into his/her armpit. Rest the isolated arm on your hip, while living your buttocks off the ground and driving your ribs into his/her chest. As soon as your opponent tries to establish a frame with his/her free arm, use your nearside arm to weave in from under your opponent's armpit behind his/her head to establish head and arm control.
