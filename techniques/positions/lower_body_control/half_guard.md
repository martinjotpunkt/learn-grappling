# Half Guard
Half Guard differentiates between bottom and top player, where top player sits on his knees and the bottom player lies on the side, sticking the bottom leg inbetween the top players legs and bending it so it can touch the top leg which is kept on the side of the top player. The outside leg can be brought into the top players center to stop him from pressuring, forming the [[Z-guard]].
For a Half Guard to be successful in stopping the top players progression, the bottom player needs to keep his outside hip and his outside shoulder up.

### Leglocks
From Half- or Z-Guard bring your top leg to the top players opposite hip by either pulling it back and pushing it across his center line or inverting and swinging it in front of him to the other side.
Clinch down on the hip with the knee and bring it your calf into his back.
The top arm secures the leg while the bottom arm grabs the heel.
When the leg is secured push your hip and legs out to sweep your opponent and attack using a toe hold, kneebar, straight ankle, inside- or outside heelhook.

### [[kneebar|Kneebar]] from [[half_guard#Lockdown|Lockdown]]
Go to deep half-guard and establish electric hooks while keeping the lockdown. Leverage your opponent on top of you until his/her knee reaches your hip. Lower the farside arm from the flank to just under the buttocks and hug your opponent's leg using a [[grips#Butterfly Grip|butterfly grip]]. Bring your inside leg onto of the entangled leg's calf and your outside foot on top of that.
