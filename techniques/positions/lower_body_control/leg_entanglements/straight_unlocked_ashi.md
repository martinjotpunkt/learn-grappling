# Straight Unlocked Ashi
The Ashi Garami (meaning Leg Entanglement) is the overall name for leg entanglement positions. Name composition depends on whether the attacked leg is going straight (which is the default and omitted in the name) over your hip line or is bend inwards (cross) and the lock poisition of your own legs (inside, beeing the default).
This naming composition and the omitted defaults leaves the straight inside Ashi as the default Ashi Garami configuration. In this position you wrap your opponents ankle in your armpit, clench the attacked leg's thigh between your own, connect the top of your inside foot to his/her buttcheek and drive your outside leg's ankle into his/her hip.
