* Use one Hand to grab their akle and glue your buttocks to their shoelace and outer thigh onto their shin, while pushing your same side leg into their hip of the trapped leg.
* Your other leg hooks your opponent's other side leg on their ankle or kneepit, while that side's arm fences off his advancements.
* When you feel your opponent off balance, push the hip resting foot into their hip, lift the held ankle off the ground and pull the hooked leg towards you.
* Either overhook their leg from the grabbed ankle, shelve their heel get top position or go directly into leglocks.
* #### Wrestle Up Variation
	When your foot on the hip slides off to the outside, sit up, release the ankle and use that hand to get a deep hook on the same leg.
